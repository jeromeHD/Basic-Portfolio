        <p>My name is Jerome Joseph Magolan III and I am 36 years old.  I was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and moved to Raleigh, NC when I was 
            4 years old.  I was raised in Raleigh and attneded the University of North Carolina at Wilmington for college, graduating with a 
            degree in Communications Studies.
        </p>
    
        <p>After college I moved to Blacksburg, Virgina to pursue a career racing sports cars with Bimmerworld Racing.  At the time we fieled 3 BMW 325i's 
            in the Pirelli World Challenge.  I started as a fly-in crew member while in college and was hired full time out of college as a car cheif.  After
            a couple years on the race team I moved to the front office managing the buisness in order to pursue my own career racing with a Spec E30 car
            which I built with the skills I had learned on the race team.  
        </p>

        <p>A few years later I moved back to the Raleigh area and settled in Durham.  I currently ride my 1976 Harley Davidson which I built from an untouched frame 
            to the chopper it has become.  I can be found around town riding my motorcycle, watching football or attending the Carolina Hurricanes home games.
